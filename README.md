PLEXIL-V
========

The Plan Execution Interchange Language ([PLEXIL](http://plexil.sourceforge.net)) is an open source synchronous language developed by [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov) for commanding and monitoring autonomous systems.

PLEXIL Formal Interactive Verification Environment (PLEXIL-V) is a tool that contains a formal executable semantics of PLEXIL specified as a rewriting logic specification in the [Maude](http://maude.cs.illinois.edu/) system.

PLEXIL-V provides an LTL model-checker of PLEXIL plans and a framework to model PLEXIL execution environments for verification.


### Current Release

PLEXIL-V v0.6.1 (February-2026)


### Requirements

* **Glasgow Haskell Compiler** (v9.6.7): The recommended way is to use [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/).

* **The Maude System**: Binary releases for different platforms can be found [here](https://github.com/maude-lang/Maude/releases).

* **Python** (>= 3.9): Binary releases for different platforms can be found [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).


## First steps

The components of PLEXIL-V are organized in the following directories:
- `plexil2maude` translator from PLEXIL XML format to PLEXIL-V internal format.
- `plexilog` log processing tools to compare PLEXIL-V against PLEXIL executive runs.
- `python` integrated command line interface (called `plexilv`) for different PLEXIL-V tools and workflows.
- `plexil` git submodule with the official PLEXIL executive version that is supported by PLEXIL-V.
- `semantics` the rewriting logic specification in Maude that implements the formal semantics and the auxiliary tools needed for model-checking and modeling execution environments.
- `examples` for showcasing how to verify properties of PLEXIL plans.


### Compile `plexil2maude` and `plexilog`

From the root of the repository, where the `cabal.project` file is located, install everything with cabal:
```
$ cabal install --overwrite-policy=always all
```
This will compile and install the tools located in the `plexil2maude` and `plexilog` folders.
Immediately after, confirm that the compiled tools are accessible from the command line by running:
```
$ plx2maude
$ plexilog-diff
```
Otherwise, add the folder containing those commands to the `PATH`.


### Install the `plexilv` command **(optional, but recommended)**

From the root of the repository, create a Python virtual environment and load it to be able to install packages:
```
$ python3 -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```
Then, install the Python `plexilv-cli` package located `python/plexilv-cli`:
```
pip install -e python/plexilv-cli
```
Immediately after, confirm that `plexilv` is accessible from the command line by running:
```
$ plexilv
$ plexilv run --help
$ plexilv diff --help
```


### Compile the PLEXIL interpreter

To install the official PLEXIL executive, checkout the `plexil` submodule of this repository:
```
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```
Then follow the instructions located in the [official repository](https://github.com/plexil-group/plexil).

If you run into issues while compiling, the minimal set of tools needed for PLEXIL-V can be obtained by running the following commands from the `plexil` folder:
```
$ make ipc
$ make tools -j
```

After adding the `plexil/scripts` folder to the `PATH` environment variable, the following commands should be available:
```
$ plexilc
$ plexiltest
```


### Semantics

The semantics is inside the `semantics/src/` folder.
The file that needs to be imported to access all the semantics is the `semantics/src/plexil-v.maude` file:
```
$ maude semantics/src/plexil-v.maude
```
The `PLEXIL-V` module should be visible.
```
Maude> show module PLEXIL-V .
```


### Examples

The `examples/` folder, contains some examples of PLEXIL plans with properties to verify.

#### Verification of properties

As a verification example, let's use `TakeImage0` folder, which contains a PLEXIL plan controlling a camera that can move to point at its target before taking a photo, if necessary.

Two environment model files are provided to model the environment of execution of the plan.
`env0.maude` models an environment in which the camera is always pointing at its target, while `env1.maude` models that the camera can be moved away from the target at any execution step.

The example properties to verify are contained in `properties.maude`.

Some Maude scripts are provided to automate the loading and execution of the models:
  - `loadX.maude` scripts load the `TakeImage0` plan and the environment `envX.maude`.
  - `check.maude` contains the commands to execute to verify the different properties.
Before executing any of the previous scripts the PLEXIL-V main module `plexil-v.maude` has to be loaded into Maude.

To verify the properties in `env0.maude` we would run the following commands:
```
$ cd examples/TakeImage0
$ make                     # compiles the plans
$ maude ../../semantics/src/plexil-v.maude load0.maude check.maude
```
Then we can confirm that all the properties hold:
```
...
==========================================
reduce in M-CHECK : plexilModelCheck(init, correctness1, transitionCounterexample) .
rewrites: 6872 in 1ms cpu (1ms real) (4032863 rewrites/second)
result Bool: true
==========================================
...
```
However, if we try to verify them over `env-1.maude`:
```
$ cd examples/TakeImage
$ maude ../../semantics/src/plexil-v.maude load1.maude check.maude
```
some of them fail:
```
...
==========================================
reduce in M-CHECK : plexilModelCheck(init, correctness1, transitionCounterexample) .
rewrites: 8316 in 2ms cpu (2ms real) (3977044 rewrites/second)
result TransitionCounterexample:
Start
-->
Input(stateLookup('PointedAtTarget, nilarg, val(true)))
-->
Input(commandAck('camera_capture_image, val(50) val(1), CommandSuccess) stateLookup('PointedAtTarget, nilarg, val(false)))
-->
Loop{

Input(stateLookup('PointedAtTarget, nilarg, val(true)))
--> Input(stateLookup('PointedAtTarget, nilarg, val(false)))
}
==========================================
...
```
Note that a counterexample is provided for each of the failures.

The example property `correctness1`, defined as `hasStatus('TakeImage, executing) U hasStatus('TakeImage, finished)`, states that the root node of the plan remains in the `EXECUTING` status until it eventually reaches the `FINISHED` state.

This property clearly holds when the camera is always pointing at its target (as in `env0.maude`) but not if it can move (as in `env1.maude`), since in the latter case, an invariant condition in the plan is violated, preventing the root node from finishing.


#### Running plans with the formal interpreter **(optional)**

Executing a plan in PLEXIL-V follows a similar approach to running tests with the `plexiltest` utility found in the official PLEXIL release.
First, you have an input `.ple` plan and input `.pst` script that you compile by using the official `plexilc` compiler into the internal PLEXIL XML formats `.plx` and `.psx`, respectively.
Then, you call the interpreter with the compiled files and observe the output.

For example, in the `TakeImage0` example, the plan and script input files would be compiled like this:
```
$ cd examples/TakeImage0
$ plexilc TakeImage0.ple
$ plexilc script1.pst
```
And the PLEXIL-V formal interpreter would be invoked with the following command:
```
$ plexilv run -p TakeImage0.plx -s script1.psx
```
Currently, the output of the interpreter is the sequence of synchronous transitions performed by the plan.


#### Performing differential testing PLEXIL/PLEXIL-V **(optional)**

PLEXIL-V provides the `plexilv diff` utility to perform differential testing of the execution of a PLEXIL plan with multiple input scripts between the official PLEXIL test executor (`plexiltest`) and the PLEXIL-V formal interpreter (`plexil run`).
First, you have an input `.ple` plan and multiple input `.pst` scripts that you compile into the internal PLEXIL XML formats `.plx` and `.psx`, respectively.
Then you call `plexilv diff` with all those inputs, obtaining a summary of differences found during execution.

For example, in the `TakeImage0` example, the plan and scripts inputs would be compiled like this:
```
$ cd examples/TakeImage0
$ plexilc TakeImage0.ple
$ plexilc script0.pst
$ plexilc script1.pst
```
And the PLEXIL-V differential testing tool would be invoked like this:
```
$ plexilv diff -p TakeImage0.plx -s script0.psx -s script1.psx
```
