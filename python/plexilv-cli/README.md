# plexilv-cli

Unified command-line interface for PLEXIL-V verification tools.

## Overview

`plexilv-cli` is a coordinator package that provides a single entry point for multiple PLEXIL verification tools:

- **run** (or **test**): Execute PLEXIL plans using the PLEXIL-V formal semantics
- **diff**: Compare PLEXIL plan executions across different interpreters
- **help**: Display help information

## Installation

### For Users

```bash
pip install plexilv-cli
```

This will automatically install all required dependencies:
- `plexilv-run` - PLEXIL plan execution tool
- `plexilv-diff` - PLEXIL execution comparison tool

### For Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
cd plexilv-cli

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Install development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Quick Start

### Running a PLEXIL Plan

Execute a PLEXIL plan using the PLEXIL-V formal semantics:

```bash
plexilv run -p plan.plx -s script.psx
```

The `test` command is an alias for `run`:

```bash
plexilv test -p plan.plx -s script.psx
```

For additional options, use `--help`:

```bash
plexilv run --help
```

### Comparing Plan Executions

Compare the execution of a PLEXIL plan across different interpreters: PLEXIL-V formal semantics and the official PLEXIL test interpreter (plexiltest).

```bash
plexilv diff -p plan.plx -s script.psx
```

Compare across multiple script files:

```bash
plexilv diff -p plan.plx -s script1.psx -s script2.psx
```

For additional options, use `--help`:

```bash
plexilv diff --help
```

### Getting Help

Display the main help message:

```bash
plexilv --help
```

Or use the help subcommand:

```bash
plexilv help
```

Display help for a specific command:

```bash
plexilv help run
plexilv help test
plexilv help diff
```

Display version information:

```bash
plexilv --version
```

### How It Works

`plexilv-cli` acts as a light wrapper that:

1. Imports Click command groups from `plexilv-run` and `plexilv-diff`
2. Registers them as subcommands under the main `plexilv` command
3. Creates the `run`/`test` alias for convenience
4. Provides a `help` subcommand for easy access to help information
5. Delegates all functionality to the underlying packages

Each subcommand package maintains its own:
- Implementation and logic
- Comprehensive test suite
- Independent CLI entry point

This design allows both standalone usage and coordinated CLI access.

## Commands

### `plexilv run` / `plexilv test`

Execute PLEXIL plans using the PLEXIL-V formal semantics.

**Provided by:** `plexilv-run`

**Common options:**
- `-p, --plan TEXT`: Path to PLEXIL plan file (required)
- `-s, --script TEXT`: Path to PLEXIL script file (required)

**Additional options:**

Both `run` and `test` support additional options beyond `-p` and `-s`. Use `--help` to see the complete list of available options:

```bash
plexilv run --help
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Basic execution
plexilv run -p my_plan.plx -s my_script.psx

# Using test alias
plexilv test -p my_plan.plx -s my_script.psx

# View all available options
plexilv run --help
```

### `plexilv diff`

Compare PLEXIL plan executions across different interpreters.

**Provided by:** `plexilv-diff`

**Purpose:**

The `diff` command executes a PLEXIL plan using two different interpreters and compares their outputs:
1. **PLEXIL-V formal semantics interpreter** - For formal verification
2. **Official PLEXIL test interpreter** (plexiltest) - For comparison

This is useful for validating that the formal semantics implementation matches the behavior of the official PLEXIL interpreter.

**Common options:**
- `-p, --plan TEXT`: Path to PLEXIL plan file (required)
- `-s, --script TEXT`: Path to PLEXIL script file (can be used multiple times)

**Multiple script files:**

You can compare executions across multiple script files by specifying `-s` multiple times:

```bash
plexilv diff -p plan.plx -s script1.psx -s script2.psx
```

**Additional options:**

The `diff` command supports additional options. Use `--help` to see the complete list of available options:

```bash
plexilv diff --help
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Compare execution with single script
plexilv diff -p my_plan.plx -s my_script.psx

# Compare execution with multiple scripts
plexilv diff -p my_plan.plx -s script1.psx -s script2.psx

# View all available options
plexilv diff --help
```

### `plexilv help`

Display help information for the main command or specific subcommands.

**Usage:**
```bash
# Show main help
plexilv help

# Show help for specific command
plexilv help run
plexilv help test
plexilv help diff
```

**Examples:**
```bash
plexilv help              # Show main help
plexilv help run          # Show run command help
plexilv help diff         # Show diff command help
plexilv help invalid-cmd  # Error: unknown command
```

## Testing

### Run All Tests

```bash

```

### Run Specific Test Class

```bash

```

### Test Coverage

Unit tests verify:
- ✅ CLI help text and version display
- ✅ All subcommands are properly registered
- ✅ `run` and `test` are correct aliases
- ✅ `diff` command is registered separately
- ✅ `help` command works for all subcommands
- ✅ Command invocation works correctly
- ✅ Invalid commands are handled properly
- ✅ PLEXIL-V formal semantics are mentioned in help text
